# Daml Open Marketplace

This is an open-source example of an application written in [Daml](https://daml.com/), that allows for the setup of a configurable market-in-a-box. The application covers workflows for issuing assets, conducting auctions, listing market pairs, trading, and settlement.

A UI written in React and Typescript is also provided.

Try out the whole application easily via [Daml Hub](https://hub.daml.com).

- Create a free Daml Hub account
- Deploy `DA Marketplace` from the Sample Apps list after logging in
- Click on the ledger after it's created in the Workspace
- Finally, follow the [user guide](./docs/user_guide.md) to walk through the available features

## v0.2.0

The newest version of the app contains a rewrite of the Daml models. They are now more flexible and featureful than the ones from the `v0.1.x` series, and it is recommended to upgrade.

If you've cloned this repository in the past, there are some changes to the branches. First, the default branch has changed from `master` to `main`. `main` now contains the 0.2.x series of code, and the old 0.1.x series HEAD now lives on the branch `0.1.x`.

To get up to date, run the following:

```shell
$ git fetch
$ git checkout main
$ git remote set-head origin main
$ git remote prune origin
$ git branch -d master
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Requirements

To run the marketplace locally, or build it to be deployed on Daml Hub, the following requirements are necessary:

1. Daml Connect (1.12)
2. `daml-dit-ddit` (0.5.x)
3. `make` (3.x)
4. `yq` (3.x)
5. `python` (3.8)
6. `poetry` (1.0.x)
7. `node` (14.x)
8. `yarn` (1.22.x)

Instructions for installing Daml can be found [here](https://docs.daml.com/getting-started/installation.html).

Install `daml-dit-ddit` with `pip3 install daml-dit-ddit` after configuring Python. This provides you with an
executable command called `ddit`. Verify the installation by running `ddit --help` in a terminal to display the
options.

## Build &amp; Deployment

See the instructions on [building and deploying from source to Daml Hub](./docs/damlhub_deployment.md).
