# Daml Open Marketplace

This is an open-source example of an application written in [Daml](https://daml.com/), that allows for the setup of a configurable market-in-a-box. The application covers workflows for issuing assets, conducting auctions, listing market pairs, trading, and settlement.

A UI written in React and Typescript is also provided.

Run the application without requiring any technical experience, via [Daml Hub](https://hub.daml.com).

- Create a free Daml Hub account
- Deploy `DA Marketplace` from the Sample Apps list after logging in
- Click on the ledger after it's created
- Finally, follow the [user guide](./docs/user_guide.md) to walk through the available features.

## v0.2.0

The newest version of the app contains a rewrite of the Daml models. They are now more flexible and featureful than the ones from the `v0.1.x` series, and it is recommended to upgrade.

If you've cloned this repository in the past, there are some changes to the branches. First, the default branch has changed from `master` to `main`. `main` now contains the 0.2.x series of code, and the old 0.1.x series HEAD now lives on the branch `TBD`.

To get up to date, run the following:

```shell
$ TBD
```

## Build &amp; Deployment
