# Marketplace

This is an initial example of how to setup a marketplace where digital tokens
can be issued and exchanged.

# Requirements
To run the marketplace locally or to build to be deployed on DABL, the following requirements are necessary:
1. DAML SDK (1.7)
2. `python` (3.8)
3. `yarn` (1.22.x)
4. `poetry` (1.0.x)
5. `make` (3.x)
6. `yq` (3.x)

# Setup

In the root folder, run:
```
make package
```

This will build the bots, the DAML dar file, build the UI components, and automatically generate the TypeScript bindings.

Whenever the DAML model is changed, you must rebuild the DAR file and regenerate the TypeScript bindings.

This can be done by rebuilding the project using `make clean && make package`.

Alternatively, to only build the DAR file and regenerate the TypeScript bindings:
```
daml build
daml codegen js .daml/dist/da-marketplace-0.1.14.dar -o daml.js
cd ui
yarn install --force --frozen-lockfile
```

`yarn` will automatically rebuild components as they are changed while running, or you can build them manually with `yarn build`.

# Running Locally

To run the sample app locally in the background using the Makefile, follow these steps:

```
# start the DAML server
make start_daml_server

# wait for the navigator to pop up...

# start all bots
make start_bots

# if you would like to use the included matching engine:
make start_matching_engine

# start the UI
cd ui
yarn start
```

This will spin up the DAML Sandbox, run the automation bots, and run a yarn server for the frontend.

The DAML Sandbox will automatically be bootstrapped with contracts from `daml/Setup.daml`.

If you would like to change which DAML Script file is run when the DAML Sandbox starts, you can modify the `init-script` field in `daml.yaml`.

To access the frontend, point your browser to `http://localhost:3000`. To view the DAML ledger state in the DAML Navigator, point your browser to `http://localhost:7500`.

To stop running background processes:
```
# stop the DAML server
make stop_daml_server

# stop all bots
make stop_bots

# if you are using the included matching engine:
make stop_matching_engine
```

Alternatively to running the DAML server in the background, `daml start` can be run in a separate terminal window.

Running the bots manually can be done with:
```
cd {bot_folder}
(DAML_LEDGER_URL=localhost:6865 poetry run python bot/{bot_name}_bot.py
```

# Running in DABL
These instructions will show you how to build and deploy the Marketplace to the DABL cloud service.

### Build the DIT file
First, rebuild the project.
```
make clean && make package
```

This will build the model, UI, and bots, as well as package the project in a `.dit` file which can be uploaded to DABL.

### Create the Project
Open http://projectdabl.com. Once you are logged in, click on "New Project":

![1_create_project](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71082197/98857327-ec817480-242c-11eb-9bfe-972dd5b7aa7b.png)

Next, enter a name and a ledger name for this project:

![2_name_project](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71082197/98857328-ec817480-242c-11eb-9d03-8e7a0f260dd1.png)

Once the project is created, click on the ledger in the project explorer. This will take you to the project's console.

### Upload and launch the DAR model and UI
Under the deployments tab, click on "Upload File":

![3_upload_file](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71082197/98857330-ec817480-242c-11eb-8b07-4b0f88d3a39f.png)

Upload the following files from the `target` folder:
`da-marketplace-ui-0.0.X.zip`
`da-marketplace-model-0.0.X.dar`

Click "Launch" for both the UI and the Model:

![4_launch_dar](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71082197/98964004-4c802580-24d6-11eb-83bf-221a9d2ce9fa.png)

### Add the parties
Next, add the parties. Click on the "Live Data" tab, and first add the `Public` and `UserAdmin` parties by clicking the "Plus" next to their names:

![5_add_public](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71082197/98857333-ed1a0b00-242c-11eb-809a-a7a8a5e983ef.png)

Add the following parties by clicking the "+ Add Party" button: `Alice`, `Bob`, `Exchange`, `Broker`, `UsdtIssuer`, `BtcIssuer` and `Custodian`:

![6_add_parties](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71082197/98857334-ed1a0b00-242c-11eb-8f6a-4e385baca6f8.png)

### Bootstrap with example data (optional)
Click the "Ledger Settings" tab, and download the `participants.json` file:

![7_participants](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71082197/98857335-ed1a0b00-242c-11eb-9074-ff3c9d3c32f3.png)

In your marketplace repo:
```
# creates a ledger_parties.json file that maps the DABL party IDs to party names
./create_ledger_parties.py path/to/participants.json ledger_parties.json

# runs a DAML Script that adds all relevant information to the project ledger
daml script --participant-config participants.json --json-api --dar .daml/dist/da-marketplace-0.0.2.dar --script-name Setup:doSetup --input-file ledger-parties.json
```
If you would like to boostrap the marketplace with your own data, you can either change the `doSetup` function in `daml/Setup.daml`, or create your own setup function and change the `--script-name` to `MyModule:myFunction`.

### Add the Operator Role Contract

If you have **not** bootstrapped the data, you must manually add a role contract for the `UserAdmin` party.

On the "Live Data" tab, select the `UserAdmin` party and click "Add Contract":
![oc01_select_add](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71082197/101641394-b0c3d580-39ff-11eb-94bd-6198dce25b70.png)

Then, select the `Marketplace.Operator:Operator` template, and fill in `UserAdmin` for the `Operator` field, and `Public` for the `Public` field and click "Submit":

![oc02_submit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71082197/101641542-e072dd80-39ff-11eb-878e-7353730a46a6.png)


### Upload and deploy the Trigger Automation
Upload the `da-marketplace-triggers-x.x.x.dar` file.

In the deployments tab, launch and configure each trigger with the following parties:

| Trigger            | Party           |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| `OperatorTrigger`  | `UserAdmin`     |
| `ExchangeTrigger`  | `Exchange`      |
| `MatchingEngine`   | `Exchange`      |
| `CustodianTrigger` | `Custodian`     |
| `CCPTrigger`       | `Ccp`           |
| `BrokerTrigger`    | `Broker`        |

Note that the `OperatorTrigger` running as the `UserAdmin` trigger is required to have the app run. If you are choosing to bootstrap your own data with different parties, the remaining triggers can be set up for each party performing those respective roles.

After uploading, add the first configuration (the human readable name has no bearing on the functionality of the bot), and click launch:

![t01_deploy_action](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71082197/101640600-b371fb00-39fe-11eb-844e-1fc939f8f806.png)

For the rest of the deployments, first click the deployed trigger:
![t02_click_bot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71082197/101640601-b371fb00-39fe-11eb-8be6-f5a1e6d2489f.png)

Then "Configure New Deployment":
![t03_configure_new](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71082197/101640602-b371fb00-39fe-11eb-9248-2e4d8938d275.png)

### View UI

After all deployments are running, you can click the "View Site" button to visit the Marketplace UI:

![11_view_site](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71082197/98857340-edb2a180-242c-11eb-9989-55aafc66199f.png)

The Party ID/Party JWTs to use to login with various parties can be found on the "Users" tab of the console:

![u01_user_tab](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71082197/101642392-f3d27880-3a00-11eb-8ea5-3cdf64c3828b.png)

### Exberry Matching Engine (optional)
If you would like to use the [Exberry Matching Engine](https://exberry.io/) instead of the matching engine trigger, first add the integration to your project on the "Browse Integrations" tab:

![12_exberry_integration](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71082197/98867810-32463900-243d-11eb-862d-0a9b322c6fef.png)

Next, in deployments, click on the Integration and configure it with your Exberry credentials and click "Launch". It should run as the `Exchange` party:

![13_click_exberry](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71082197/98867872-50139e00-243d-11eb-8448-479e46fd85df.png)

Finally, upload the `da-marketplace-exberry-adapter-0.0.2.tar.gz` file in the `target` folder and launch the automation as `Exchange`.

If you would like to change which `SID` the Exberry adapter begins counting at for the `orderId` calls to Exberry, create a `Marketplace.Utils.ExberrySID` contract as the `Exchange` party _after_ launching the adapter.
